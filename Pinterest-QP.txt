Project Name: Pinterest
Project Description:
Pinterest is indeed a social media platform that revolves around the visual discovery and
sharing of content. Users can create accounts to explore and save content, known as "Pins,"
which are typically images or videos that link to external websites. Users can organize their
Pins on virtual:boards, categorizing them based on different interests or themes. It uses
microservice architecture' in which multiple. microservices work together to give a seamless
experience 'to. users. The backend of the application! is built using Spring Framework whereas
the frontend i is built using Angular/React.

Major Modules: .

microservices. communicate with each other using REST API . The following microservices

will be implemented: oe .

e. User Authentication | 'Service: This microservi e will be responsible for user

authentication, and managing user profile. It will: provide APIs for user registration,
authentication, and: 'updating user profiles. a

retrieval of Pins and Boards. It also handles image and video uploads, metadata
storage, and content versioning.

Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance: The application should be fast and responsive, with quick load times
and minimal lag or delay.

Scalability: The application should be able to handle large amounts of traffic and
scale as'needed to accommodate growth.

Security: The application should be secure and protect user data from unauthorized
access, with measures such as encryption and secure authentication. Secure
password storage using hashing. Protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g.,
SQL injection, xSS).

Reliability: The application should be reliable and available, with minimal downtime
or outages.

Usability: The application should be easy to use and intuitive, with a clear and
consistent user interface. I

Maintainability: The application should be easy to maintain and update, with clear
and well-organized code that is easy to understand and modify.

Compatibility: The application should be compatible with a wide range of devices and
browsers, with support for different screen sizes and resolutions.

Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance.

Session Management: Implement secure session management techniques to

prevent unauthorized access. Consider using short-lived sessions with automatic
timeouts.

Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading techniques for images and other content,
ensuring faster initial page loads and smoother user experience.

User Interface (Ul) and User Experience (UX) Design: Design an intuitive user interface
that is easy to navigate and provides a seamless user experience. Prioritize
responsiveness and clarity across all devices (desktop, mobile, tablets).
